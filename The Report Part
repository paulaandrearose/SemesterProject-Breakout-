Project Milestone #3
Report Part
At first our main problem we came across was communicating and organizing specifically our 
time in order to meet with one another. We had to figure out how, initially, five people would
fit into their busy schedules to come and work together. Through the duration of the project we
enhanced our communication and met up throughout the week, be it between classes and/or after 
class. As far as C++ goes we learned to work with SDL. We also learned how to collaborate on GitHub
to work through our project. We made a Facebook group along with a groupme to better keep in touch 
too. We learned how to program better by implementing a makefile, many classes and header files.  We
quickly learned that the most important part of this programming assignment was team work. We felt 
the pressure most when one of the members had to leave the class. Our end game of our program was 
the most difficult also best written code than anything that any one member could complete. In the
real industry software or not there are strict deadlines for when jobs need to be completed.  We 
learned to distribute the work and create hard deadlines for each other to meet the actually deadline.
The project made us better prepared to write code by creating an ability to make readable, reusable 
and efficient code.  This knowledge is very valuable because we can use it in our future careers.  
Though we were not all the same major, it gave us a diversity edge in the way we thought and made 
solutions. For the future, we plan on bringing this game to an app to play via phone/tablet and get
as many people to enjoy the game just as we have. As for improvements, we’d like to better the graphics
and have a level generator, and smoother animations.  The team feels that we’ve created a great connection
to one another therefore we want to keep in touch to work on future projects because we work well and are 
skilled workers, a great combination!
